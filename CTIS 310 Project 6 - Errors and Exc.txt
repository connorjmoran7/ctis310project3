CTIS 310 Project 6 - Errors and Exceptions List

1. NumberFormatException

This is caused when inputting a String, double, or an int out of range.

Other possibilities (Things that can be wrong, but don't send an error)

1. BadMakeException and BadModelException

If the make or model field recieves the input of anything but a String,
the program will prompt the user to enter a String.


2. BadYearException

If the car's year was entered as greater than 2024, or older than 1980,
the program should send an error and prompt the user for a input within
the proper range.

3. BadMileageException

Entering a number under 0 would throw this error, or entering a number over
500,000 would also trigger it. The prompt would signal for the user to input
a reasonable value.

4. BadPriceException

A price below 0 would not be possible, and a price over $100,000 would also be out
of the range. (For the car dealership I've designed)
